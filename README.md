- Reconstruction of digitized frescoes.

## Problematic :
- Template matching with no view change.

## Limitations :
- Large number of fragments
- Irregular shape of fragments
- Uniqueness and non-overlapping constraints

# Perspectives and conclusion

## SuperGlue+ SuperPoint
- The method doesnâ€™t need learning.

- Parameters can be tuned to improve performance

- SuperGlueplaces the fragments in a precise way on the fresco, but it places less.

## D2Net

- Creation of a database of ground truth to do the Learning.

- To do this, we must calculate the keypoints using the classic methods (+ random keypoints with a rotation of the fragments to increase the database)

- D2NET places many fragments but in a less precise way.
